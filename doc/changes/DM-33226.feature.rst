* Changed the config loader method such that if a relative path is specified inside another config it is treated as being relative to that original config file.
* Modified the config loader to support URI schemes ``file``, ``resource``, and ``eups`` supported by ``lsst-resources``.
  This change means that in some cases ``__file__`` can be a URI string and not a simple path.
